                    <br>
                    <b>Physiotherapy</b> is a branch of medicine that uses techniques such as advanced muscle release, 
                    joint mobilization and acupuncture to help treat most injuries. 
                    They also may use therapeutic modalities such as heat, ultrasound, IFC, and exercises to help in your recovery. 
                    Through their extensive training and education your physiotherapist can do wonders for patients 
                    suffering from a multitude of problems which may cause pain and immobility.
                    <br><br>
                    According to the <i>Ontario Physiotherapy Association</i>, physiotherapy offers a range of specialized 
                    services of benefit to patients with heart and lung disease, traumatic workplace and athletic injuries, 
                    amputations, arthritic joints, stroke, brain injury, spinal cord and nerve injury, cancer and 
                    pre- and post-surgical needs. With time, dedication, and effort, physiotherapy can help patients 
                    find relief and live normal, healthy lives.

                    What are some of the benefits of physiotherapy?

                        <b>Better sleep cycle</b><br>
                    Dealing with constant pain can be mentally as well as physically exhausting. Often, patients with 
                    chronic pain have a difficult time sleeping, but a good night’s sleep is essential to recovery. 
                    Physiotherapy integrates light exercises, with their treatments that helps to release endorphins, 
                    reducing the pain felt by the patient. This helps you sleep better at night and restore a healthy sleep cycle. 
                    Getting adequate sleep also plays a big role in your recovery time, so if you are not well rested, 
                    your body will feel more sensitive and irritable to aches and pains. Physiotherapy gives you just the right 
                    kind of light exercise that you need to stretch out and loosen your muscles and give you relief from pain.

                    <b>Drug-free option</b><br>
                    With habit-forming opioid pain relievers being increasingly questioned for their 
                    true benefits in the media, physiotherapy is becoming even more attractive.
                    Physiotherapy uses therapeutic manual techniques along with drug-free modalities,
                    such as ultrasound, laser and acupuncture to ease you of your discomfort. 
                    This drug-free style of treatment is a great option for relieving your signs and 
                    symptoms from injuries or other chronic pain.

                    <b>Restored activity</b><br>
                    Physiotherapy can help you regain physical strength, flexibility, 
                    and functionality. Not only will this allow one to continue everyday tasks after an 
                    injury but it also reduces the risk of the injury recurring again. This form of treatment 
                    is helpful for anybody who suffer from a physical disability, chronic pain, or injury, 
                    allowing them to gain strength and mobility to perform everyday tasks without difficulty.

                    <b>Be pain free</b><br>
                    With issues such as chronic pains, people feel that their chances of ever 
                    getting complete relief without being dependent on medications and 
                    painkillers is very low. However, a physiotherapist can help you reduce, 
                    and in many cases completely eliminate, pain. 
                    This kind of a treatment option ensures that you do not get dependent on any kind of medication, 
                    as pain relief medications can get addictive.

                    <b>Stay confident</b><br>
                    Often, after suffering from an injury, many individuals lose confidence in themselves and their abilities. 
                    This can lead to anxiety and depression as persons injury fails to be resolved and pain is now chronic, 
                    which also affects the successful outcome of a treatment. However, with proper physiotherapy, 
                    you will be able to regain your confidence in a timely recovery and the skilled professionals at 
                    Elite Physio will ensure that you receive the best treatment for your injuries or pain,

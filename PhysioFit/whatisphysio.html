                A common question for people that have never visited a physiotherapist is the very basic question of 
                <b>“What is Physiotherapy?”</b>. Physiotherapy encompasses rehabilitation, 
                injury prevention and health promotion/fitness. 
                The profession employs a holistic approach to treatment, 
                looking at the patient’s lifestyle and engaging them in their own treatment.
